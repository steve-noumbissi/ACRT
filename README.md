# ACRT 3.1.0
# Project Title
**Accessibility Conformance Reporting Tool (ACRT)** 

ACRT is a browser-based standalone application for recording accessibility test results from Trusted Testers. All input data will be stored as JSON &/or html files in the local machine which can be shared as needed. Information in the JSON file can be further manipulated for analytics and reporting purposes as needed. 
Try [ACRT Here](https://acrttool.github.io/ACRTTest/ )

## Getting Started
1) Download the ACRT files to your local machine from the repository. The default location is the Downloads folder. On the [main page](https://github.com/Section508Coordinators/ACRT), select the Code button above and select "Download ZIP". Once downloaded, unzip/extract files. 
2) Refer to the [ACRT Training Manual](https://github.com/Section508Coordinators/ACRT/blob/master/Resources/ACRTTrainingManual.pdf ) in the 'Resources' folder for detailed instructions. 


## Instructions
1) After ACRT is downloaded, unzip/extract the files and open index.html  (preferred browsers are Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Google Chrome). <br />
2) Select [Instructions](https://github.com/Section508Coordinators/ACRT/blob/master/Resources/ACRTTrainingManual.pdf ) to view a detailed instruction manual in accessible PDF format. <br />
3) Select **'Create Report'** to create or edit test results. 
4) Select and load either the standard template JSON file (TT4 or TT5 JSON file from 'Resources' folder for the first time) or a valid custom JSON file that you have created or pre-filled for editing. <br />

5) Once you have filled/edited all required fields, you will see the option to save test results.
6) To save file changes, use the keyboard shortcut (Alt+z) or the Save button located at the bottom of the page.<br/>
7) The file will be saved to your local machine (Downloads folder by default) as a JSON file. This can be used for further editing or reporting purposes. <br />
8) Select **'View Report'** to view test results you have saved (with at least one valid test result). This is a read-only page; no edits are allowed. To save as a printer-friendly HTML file, use the keyboard shortcut (Alt+s) or Save button located at the bottom of the page.<br/>
9) You should save test results in both JSON (for editing) and HTML format (user-friendly) for future reference. <br/>
